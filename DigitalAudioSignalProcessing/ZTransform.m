%% Why Z-transform?
%
% # The Z-transform is a powerful tool for analyzing discrete-time systems.
% # It is the discrete-time counterpart of the Laplace transform, which is
% used to analyze continuous-time systems.
% # The Z-transform is useful in the design and analysis of discrete-time
% systems.
% # It provides a convenient representation of the input-output behavior
% of discrete-time systems.
% # The Z-transform is also useful in solving difference equations.
% The Z-transform is a generalization of the DTFT.
% # The DTFT is the Z-transform evaluated on the unit circle.
