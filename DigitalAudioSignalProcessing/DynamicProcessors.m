%% Dynamic Interval of The Signal
% It is the ratio of the maximum amplitude of the signal to the maximum
% amplitude of the signal. It is a dimensionless quantity. It also can be
% shown in dB.

%% Diagram of Dynamic Processor
% * It consists of a level detector and gain processor.
% * The level detector measures the level of the input signal and the gain
% processor adjusts the gain of the signal according to the level detector.
% * The gain processor can be a compressor or an expander.
% * The compressor reduces the gain of the signal and the expander increases
% the gain of the signal.
% * The compressor is used to reduce the dynamic range of the signal and the
% expander is used to increase the dynamic range of the signal.
